# sentiment analysis on politician tweets
data mining on tweets multi-labels classification

Goal. The purpose of this project is to analyze the tweets and use machine learning to build a classfication model which can help people to classify their attitude towards politicians.

Program Language: Python 3.7.1
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Environment: Anaconda 1.7.2

Machine Learning Model: sklearn (MultinomialNB, Support Vector Machine, RandomForestClassifier, etc)

Hyperparameter Tuning: Pipeline, GridSearchCV

Evaluation: cross_val_score, accuracy_score


## Process Steps
1. Please Install Anaconda and Jupyter programming environments. 
2. Put the training and testing data in the "inputs" directory
  2.1 The two test data files should be named as "Obama.csv" and "Romney.csv"; else you could replace the 
  2.2 
3. Create an folder "outputs" for final outputs
